# Hangman
Simple command line Hangman game, where one player plays against the computer. If you're unfamiliar with how Hangman works, see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

To start the game, navigate to project directory in the command line, and run `ruby lib/hangman.rb`

You can also save and restore your game, by entering `save` or `restore` in program's interface.

The aim of the project was to practice working with files and serialization in Ruby. You can learn more about the project [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization)
